The project will be analyzed using both \href{https://www.sonarsource.com/}{SonarQube} and \textit{Pattern4j} static code analysis tools, and also by custom-made shell scripts that collect interesting metrics about the codebase.

In the following section, the results of the analysis will be presented, highlighting potential code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities, and design patterns detected in the project.

As the configuration and usage of both tools is out of the scope of this report, the following sections will focus on the results of the analysis, providing insights into the current state of the project, and guiding the refactoring process. Refer to the respective documentation for more information on how to configure and use both tools.

\subsection{Static code analysis results}

The following subsections will provide a summary of the results obtained from the static code analysis tools used in the project.

\subsubsection{Large class detection}

In order to detect large classes, a custom bash script was developed to count the number of lines of code of each class in the project. The script uses the \texttt{cloc} tool to count the number of lines of code of each file in the project, and then orders the results by the number of lines of code in order to detect the largest classes. The following are the top 4 largest classes in the project (excluding test classes and comments):

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \texttt{com.renomad.minum.web.WebFramework} - 415 LOC
	\item \texttt{com.renomad.minum.htmlparsing.HtmlParser} - 372 LOC
	\item \texttt{com.renomad.minum.database.} - 219 LOC
	\item \texttt{com.renomad.minum.web.Response} - 214 LOC
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The average number of lines of code is 55 LOC, which is considered acceptable. These classes represents a good starting point for refactoring, as they represent largest classes in the project.

\subsubsection{Code duplication and inheritance misuse}

By manually analysing the codebase, was found that inside the \texttt{logging} and \texttt{queue} package there are multiple classes that share the same methods, which could be extracted into a common superclass in order to provide a more modular and maintainable codebase. Hence, these two classes also represent good candidates for refactoring.

\subsubsection{SonarQube analysis}

After running the SonarQube analysis on the entire Minum codebase (including tests in order to get the test coverage metric), were detected a total of 588 code smells, 26 security hotspots and 34 possible bugs (which were later confirmed as false-positives as in the testing code). In the following paragraphs the results will be briefly analyzed in order to plan the refactoring process. \autoref{tab:sonarqube_severity_summary} provides a summary of the found code smells, categorized by severity.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\caption{SonarQube Severity Issues Summary}
	\label{tab:sonarqube_severity_summary}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|p{14cm}|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Severity Type} & \textbf{Issues}                                                \\ \hline
		\textbf{Critical}      &
		\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}}
			design (90), suspicious (10), brain-overload (6) convention (1), multi-threading (1), \\
			pitfall (1)                                                                           \\
		\end{tabular}   \\ \hline
		\textbf{Major}         &
		\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}}
			cert (40), html5 (20), obsolete (19) bad-practice (17), owasp-a3 (17), cwe (16), \\
			error-handling (15), pitfall (8), suspicious (7) accessibility (5), unused (4),  \\
			wcag2-a (4) confusing (2), design (2), brain-overload (1)                        \\
		\end{tabular}        \\ \hline
		\textbf{Minor}         &
		\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}}
			convention (374), cwe (7), java8 (5), brain-overload (4), pitfall (4), performance (2), \\
			regex (2), unused (2), bad-practice (1), clumsy (1), suspicious (1)                     \\
		\end{tabular} \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent As shown in Table \ref{tab:sonarqube_severity_summary}, the most common code smells in the project are related to Java conventions, design issues, CERT secure coding standards. Even if the focus of the refactoring process will be put on design issues, also the other code smells will be kept in consideration.

\subsubsection{Pattern4j analysis}

Unfortunately, the pattern4j tool was not able to analyze the entire project codebase due to the use of Java 21 features in the project. By running the tool using the custom \texttt{run-pattern4j-headless.sh} script, the following error was raised:

\begin{verbatim}
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported class file major version 65
\end{verbatim}

\noindent For this reason, the design pattern usage analysis will be skipped. This is not a problem for the refactoring process, as it would have only provided additional insights into the design of the project rather than pinpointing specific issues.

\subsubsection{Codebase structural problems}

As cited in \autoref{sec:project_structure}, the project codebase is divided into 10 packages, each with a specific purpose. The overall structure of the codebase is showcase a very thorough organization, with each package containing a set of classes and interfaces related to a specific aspect of the library. However, by inspecting in more detail the structure of single packages three main issues were identified:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The framework defines many custom exceptions in order to handle specific errors. These exceptions are scattered across the codebase and are not properly organized. To address this issue, a new package should be created to contain all the custom exceptions, and the classes should be moved there.
	\item Inside the \texttt{logging} package there are classes which are specific for testing purposes, which should be moved to the test package.
	\item Inside the \texttt{util} package there are many self-contained utility classes that do not properly follow the single responsibility principle. Most of these classes contain multiple methods that are not related to each other, and should be split into multiple classes in order to improve the overall design of the project.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Refactoring Goals and Planning}
\label{sec:refactoring_plan}

The main goal of the refactoring is to improve the maintainability and flexibility of the codebase, by removing duplicated code, improving the overall design and ensuring adherence to best practices.

As outlined in the previous sections, the Minum project presents several code smells and design issues that need to be addressed in order to improve the overall quality of the codebase. The refactoring will aim to solve the issues related to the \texttt{logging} package by providing an hierarchy of classes allowing to better manage the logging system of the library, and make it easily extendible in the future. Additionally, the testing classes present in the \texttt{logging} package will be moved to the relative test module in order to keep the codebase organized.

Furthermore, the custom exceptions will be moved to a new package in order to better organize the codebase and, to conclude, the code duplication problem that affects the \texttt{queue} will be addressed to provide a more maintainable and flexible solution.
