Web Code
========

This directory has the code necessary for our system to communicate using the Hyper-Text
Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

_FullSystem_ - This ties together much of the functionality here for startup.  If you
examine the code, particularly `FullSystem.start()`, you will see how many variables
get initialized.  Typically, you will use `FullSystem.initialize()` to kick off your
system.
