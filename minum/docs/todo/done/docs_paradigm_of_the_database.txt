write essay on paradigm of our database - when to use it, when not, fat data vs thin, etc

The database design for Minum is intended to prioritize simplicity and minimalism
over all else.  It does not provide the kind of safety you would expect with an
ACID-compliant database.  It does not have the cornucopia of features you would
expect from a database handling enterprise-style risks.

What it does have, however, is a nearly-absurd sparseness, good performance, and
ease of use.  This means for low-risk uses, of which there are quite a number,
this small program might be just the ticket.
