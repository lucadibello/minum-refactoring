It should be possible for a user of the system to add a new photo with
a description, and for that information to become available publicly
(without requiring authentication).

This is to start off an idea for a genealogical program.  We will
follow the typical iterative approach where we try to determine the
simplest and smallest new functionality that aligns with our
overarching need.

Tasks: 
1. ability to receive photos - requires reading form/multipart data DONE
2. simple web page to send a photo: required: short description (3-20 chars), long description (0-1000 chars), the photo itself
3. simple page to view all photos, with their short and long descriptions
