I am happy to announce my minimalist zero-dependency web framework, Minum, is out of beta.
http://github.com/byronka/minum

You will be hard-pressed to find another modern project as obsessively minimalistic. Other frameworks will claim
simplicity and minimalism and then, casually, mention they are built on a multitude of libraries. This follows
self-imposed constraints, predicated on a belief that smaller and lighter is long-term better.

Caveat emptor: This is a project by and for developers who know and like programming (rather than, let us say,
configuring). It is written in Java, and presumes familiarity with the HTTP/HTML paradigm.

Driving paradigms of this project:

* ease of use 
* maintainability / sustainability 
* simplicity 
* performance 
* good documentation 
* good testing

It requires Java 21, for its virtual threads (Project Loom)
